# FTCsnapbot, by Fluffy Terminators 23369 and ACE Robotics 23335
### Robots shouldn't be hard for rookies! 

FTCsnapbot is a modular system for FTC teams that allows compatability and seamless repairs and easy robot building.

But not only is there a system for easy robot building, there's a system for easy code writing. More info will be given on release.
